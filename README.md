# UCProjectGroup1
The codebase for the project of Group 1 of the UC course (2024-2025) at Leiden University. The project focusses on integrating the Prithvi foundation model into a pre-existing model on prediction carbon emissions from sattelite imagery of power plants.

In order to run any of the code, one must first install Terratorch. Please refer to https://github.com/IBM/terratorch for a detailed overview. We recommend running on a conda virtual environment where the only install required is ```pip install terratorch```. This should install all necessary dependencies. Sometimes, a wrong version of albucore is installed (it should be 0.0.16). This is manually overwritten at the top of both classification_implementation.ipynb and segmentation.ipynb - the core files in this repo. Please ensure you have the right versions, since the code is very frail in that regard.

Parts of this codebase are taken from or by-and-large inspired by the code from Hanna et al. (2023) and their paper "Physics-Guided Multitask Learning for Estimating Power Generation and CO2 Emissions From Satellite Imagery". Please refer to their github as well: https://github.com/HSG-AIML/RemoteSensingCO2Estimation.  Where relevant, code that was not written by us is specified as such.
 Moreover, parts of the code are inspired by tutorials by Terratorch. Again, we refer to their github repository: https://github.com/IBM/terratorch.
